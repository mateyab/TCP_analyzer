# TCP Analyzer

TCP Analyzer is a Python program that processes `.cap` files to analyze TCP connections. It counts the number of connections within the capture file, calculates Round-Trip Time (RTT), and provides detailed information about packets within each connection.

## Usage

To run this program:

1. Make sure your `.cap` file, tcp.py, TCPconnection.py, packet.py, and traceStatistics.py are in the same directory.
2. Run the following command in your terminal:

    ```
    python3 tcp.py input.cap
    ```

    Replace `input.cap` with the path to the `.cap` file you want to analyze.

3. Observe the output printed in the console, which includes connection details, RTT calculations, and packet information.
